0.22.2

### Added

-   localization updates
    -   Danish
    -   Spanish
    -   Chinese
-   Rotation in Select tool with build mode
-   Floor UI updates
    -   visibility toggle
        -   "Hidden" floors are not selectable by players, BUT will still render in between other selectable layers
    -   rename floor option
    -   reorder floors by dragging them
-   Shape lock/unlock toggle
    -   Show lock/unlock icon on the selection_info component for quick edit
    -   Only players with edit access can toggle

### Changed

-   Floors are now loaded separately on startup this greatly impacts startup time
    -   The floor the user was last active on is loaded first if possible
    -   Next all floors under the active floor in descending order are loaded
    -   Lastly the floors above in ascending order are loaded
-   Other performance improvements
    -   Delay drawloop start until first floor data arrives
    -   Better handling of multi group moves
    -   Shape movement now sends less data to server
    -   Pan now only updates the visible floors on move and full recalculate on release
-   Grid pixel size is now a client setting instead of a DM setting
-   Show floor selector in the more logical order from upper to lower floors
-   Improve ruler distance text readability
-   [0.22.1] Spawn locations are no longer magically created
    -   You can now (as a DM) explicitly create spawn tokens with the right click context menu
    -   You can already create multiple spawn locations, but UI to choose between them will be for the next proper release

### Fixed

-   Aura not displaying when token is outside the visible canvas
-   Firefox location scrollbar when left menu is open
-   Some significant performance bottlenecks
-   Server now quits, referring to docs/tutorial, if client was not built before start
-   Initial state adding unnecessary fog on lower floors
-   Prefer snapped points over grid snapping
-   Remove white icon in topleft menu UI
-   Moving polygons with keyboard would only move origin point
-   Degenerate cases in triangulation
    -   Triangulation code could hit a degenerate case when dealing with slight number differences in the order of 1e-15
    -   Now the triangulation code will only take the first 10 digits after the dot into consideration to prevent numerical instability.
-   Mouseleave events where not triggered in some cases (e.g. alt tab), this could cause some shapes (e.g. rulers) to remain on the screen
-   Map tool resize does not replicate
-   Center calculation polygons with repeated points
-   Location moved shape now properly disappears on the old location
-   Asset drops on the game board that are not images located in /static are no longer accepted
    -   This fixes the possible spam of "could not load image /game/..." in your console for future cases
    -   A script has been added in the server/scripts folder to remove existing assets
-   Missing case in vision calculation script
-   [0.22.1] Server error when encountering broken spawn locations
-   [0.22.2] Drawing on FOW layer blocking UI
-   [0.22.2] Badge toggle not working properly
-   [0.22.2] Group leader not properly set serverside on paste
-   [0.22.2] Server error on shape paste due to aura type change
